This example repository will allow you to generate QRCode barcodes. You can find more information on our [Barcode Bakery website][1].

This is based on the [barcode QRCode][2] library.

The library is not free, you must [purchase a license][3] in order to obtain it.

Installation
------------

* Download the library on our [website][4], and follow our [developer's guide][5].

This repository is already setup to run the examples. However, you will need to purchase the library first.

Then, you simply need to run:
```bash
$ npm install
```

Then call a file [app-qrcode.js][6] with Node:
```bash
node src/app-qrcode.js
```
